## Where can I get it?
Follow the instructions on the [**LATEST RELEASE PAGE**](https://github.com/erdc/Antecedent-Precipitation-Tool/releases/latest)

## What is it?

An automation tool that evaluates three climatological parameters to assist in the making and documenting of various determinations required by policy for the execution of USACE&#39;s Regulatory Program.

Here is a video outlining the functionality of the APT version 1.0. Note that version 2.0 is slightly different.

## Scale
The tool can perform its analyses at a single point or at various watersheds scales to evaluate the impact of antecedent precipitation on local hydrologic conditions.

## Usage

Rapidly, accurately, and effortlessly determine whether any of the following problematic circumstances exist for a given Latitude, Longitude, and Date:

- Dry Season
- Drought Conditions
- Lower than normal antecedent precipitation
- Greater than normal antecedent precipitation
- Automatically document the basis of these decisions for the administrative record.

## Utility

- **Site Visit:** Determine whether you should use the problematic circumstances portion of the delineation manual and regional supplement
- **Data Sheet Review:** Determine whether the applicant or their agent should have used the problematic circumstances portion of the delineation manual and regional supplement
- **Satellite / Aerial Imagery Interpretation:** Determine whether the seasonality, drought conditions, and antecedent precipitation are appropriate for a given image to be used for:
  - **Hydrology Indicators:** Saturation on aerial imagery, Inundation on aerial imagery
  - **Connectivity:** Continuous saturation or inundation visible between potential WotUS
  - **Apparent differences in vegetation:**
    - Reduced vigor of upland crops in suspected depressions or swales
    - Greener vegetation in suspected depressions or swales compared to dry/yellow surrounding vegetation
    - Location and extent of any other wetland signatures (e.g. vernal pool stratified vegetation rings)
